## Behaviour of the basic calculator
- Doest not support smart calculation, for example, 3 - 2 * 2 will give 2 instead of -1.
- When you want to use previous answer as first operand, just type any operators to continue, which also means that all operators can work as "=".
- Type new operator can override the previous one. For instance, type "3", "+", "-", "1" will give you 2.
- Press "C" to clear all(restart).
- Any number divide by o will give infinity.
