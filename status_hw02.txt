Please fill in answers to the questions below:


1. What's your name?
Yexin Wang

2. What hostname did you deploy to?
hw02.ielric.com

3. What's the link to your repository on github with your code?
https://github.com/iElric/Web-Development-HW2.git

4. How many HTML / CSS tutorial exercises did you do?
Around half of them.

5. How comfortable do you feel with HTML and CSS now?
I am able to build some not too complicated web pages with them. There are definitely more fancy stuff I need to get
used to with css.

6. How many JS tutorial exercises did you do?
Nearly all of them. I also read some text books and other websites to learn JS.

7. How comfortable do you feel with JS now?
There are still some features I need to be familiar with such as use prototype to realize inheritance. And I need to
get used to some wired behaviours of JS such as this reference changes depends on context.

8. Do all of your HTML pages pass the W3C HTML validator?
(https://validator.w3.org/)
Yes.


9. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
The calculator part. I want to implement the state design pattern in JS just like whatI did in Java. However,
implementing inheritance in JS is quite complex and not intuitive. I am able to do it finally because JS is weakly typed
so I can implement polymorphism directly without inheritance.
Also, I have to read several posts to understand how keyword "this" worked in JS.
